# RPG-Tools
Tools for RPG game uses (mostly targeted towards D&amp;D at the moment) made in Java.

Currently has a "Dice Roller" that allows the user to input a number of dice, and number of sides for those dice, and "rolls" those dice using a random number generator, after which it displays the results of each "dice" and the total value of all of the dice.

>Need to add: Advantage and Disadvantage on rolls, +- modifiers on rolls

In-progress functionality includes a multitude of "Character Tools", which would allow the user to create/import new characters, and manipulate those characters. List of desired functionality is:
>Tracking of current Health, Level, XP, Gold, and Spell Points.

>Listing and ability to change all notable character stats (STR, DEX, CON, INT, WIS, CHA).

>Listing of skill check modifiers based on stats and on profeciencies and masteries.

>Listing of inventoy items, weapons, tools and supplies.

>Listing of feats and traits (Actions, Bonus Actions, Reactions, and other).

>Listing of available/known spells, their casting times, ranges, components, durations, and descriptions.

>Possible display of other misc. items on a generic character sheet (Personality Traints, Ideals, Bonds, Flaws, Background, ect.)

>All class specific features and resources.

>Long and short rest functions.

>Usage of multi-classing.

>Tracking of companions.

>Allow for addition of custom classes, races, ect. for maximum usage.

Future functionality would include online functionality to save character data to a server instead of saving locally, and DM tools, such as an initiative tracker, and notes page.
